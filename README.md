## Changes :
### Added one png file of a pixel heart which was uploaded on 3 images which where placed on the top-right corner of the canvas , these images where added the DestroyOnTrigger2D.sc input fields which are being destroyed when player makes a mistake .

### On [DestroyOnTrigger2D.sc](https://github.com/VictoKu1/HWEx4A/blob/main/Assets/Scripts/3-collisions/DestroyOnTrigger2D.cs) file added a hit counter which also controls the show-up of the life bars one the screen.
